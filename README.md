## General Information
- build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The results indicate that the class rebalance has helped to improve the results.
- After class rebalance, the model is more accurate.
- The model is not overfitting or underfitting the data.
